# Sugooianime – Anime Discovery Platform

Sugooianime is a full‑stack anime browsing and tracking platform inspired by IMDb and MyAnimeList.  
It delivers **live anime data**, **personalized user dashboards**, **watchlists**, **watching/completed tracking**, and a **history system**, all backed by a secure authentication layer and a custom API.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most anime‑browsing websites only show static lists with no personalization. Users cannot:

- Track what they’re watching
- Maintain a watchlist
- Mark anime as completed
- View history of what they opened
- Enjoy a consistent design system

Sugooianime solves this by combining real‑time API data + a custom backend + user‑specific collections.
